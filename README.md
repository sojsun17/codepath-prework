I want to make a language learning app that helps people actually talk, not just memorize vocab. The idea is to focus on real-life situations, like how to order food or ask for directions, instead of random words or grammar rules out of context. Each lesson would have short conversations and voice practice, so users can hear how something is supposed to sound and then try saying it back. There’d also be a feature that gives quick feedback on your accent and pronunciation. Over time, you’d build your own phrasebook based on stuff you actually use. I wanted to make this soley around the language Malayalam because its the language I know and want to learn! Its a language thats not very common so I hope this would be helpful to people in the future.
